This is my original portfolio website, that was built when I only knew HTML and CSS. Later I refactored it so it was made in React. 

Original portfolio website in html: https://stephendoyle10.github.io/Portfolio-in-HTML/

Refactored portfolio website using react: https://stephendoyle10.github.io

It includes the following pages:
'about' - my programming journey so far
'projects' - all the projects I have built so far
'articles' - some articles I have wrote about programming topics
'resources' - where I list all the resources that have helped me on my programming journey
'contact' - how to contact me
