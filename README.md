'Problems are opportunities in disguise'
I think we can all agree 2020 was a terrible year. With quarantines, lockdowns, self-isolations etc most of us had a lot more time on out hands. I decided to make lemonade with these lemons, and decided to really get into the weeds of a hobby I had only dabbled in in previous years: programming. Like most of us, I was already familiar with HTML and CSS, but in 2020 I started to teach myself Javascript for the first time, and quickly came to appreciate the flexibility and potential of the language.

I started by adding Javascript to HTML/CSS front-end projects as a way to produce single page web apps that were responsive to user inputs. Of course, as is the tried and tested cliched path, I programmed a calculator first! Next came an interactive javascript string method cheat sheet, and then a UK Salary Calculator.

Then I discovered that not only could Javascript be used on the frontend, but the flexibility of the language meant that developers were using it on the backend too. In fact, not only was it being used, but it was hugely popular and successful! I decided to combine my twin loves of programming and board gaming to build a full-stack social media project for baordgamers to share and discuss boardgame-related texts, pictures and links. This was built using Node.JS, Express and MongoDB, and is called Boarpp.
